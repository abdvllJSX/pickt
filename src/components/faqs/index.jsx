            question: "What does Pickt mean?",
            Answer: "Pickt is an old-fashioned spelling for 'picked' which we use to refer to the act of brain-picking. So, if you wish to pick someone's brain on a subject, we would typically refer to you as a Picker and if you wish to share your knowledge, we would call you a PRO.",

            question: "Which kind of experts do i have access to?",

            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "Can I be a Picker and a PRO at the same time?",
            Answer: "Technically, yes you can. When everyone signs up on Pickt, they have basic Picker accounts until they decide to upgrade to a PRO account if they wish to share their expertise and get paid for doing so.",
            isOpen: false

            question: "Can I withdraw unused money from Pickt wallet?",
            Answer: "Of course, you can. We understand that you might have an unexpected need for some money. So, if it's in your wallet and isn't locked down in escrow as payment for a service, then, you're free to withdraw it. It's yours anyway.",
            isOpen: false
        },
        {
            question: "Can I reach out to an Expert in another location?",
            Answer: "Oh yes! Pickt is boundless and borderless, so you can search for people in a different country as you. If they have a Pickt account, they are reachable by anyone from anywhere.",

        },
        {
            question: "Do I get a refund if the experts doesn't show up for the meeting?",
            Answer: "If the PRO doesn't show up for a meeting 100% refund. If the PRO shows up and the picker doesn't, the Picker will only be refunded 45% of their amount.",
